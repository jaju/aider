# Aider Overview

## Project Purpose

Aider is a command-line AI pair programming tool that allows developers to write and edit code with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as other models. It enables developers to start a chat session with an LLM, add their local Git repository files to the chat, and then request new code, modifications, or explanations. Aider's primary goal is to integrate AI assistance directly into the developer's existing terminal workflow, making it a seamless and efficient collaborator that can directly read, write, and modify code in the local filesystem and commit changes to Git.

It aims to:
*   **Accelerate development:** By automating routine coding tasks, generating boilerplate, and suggesting solutions.
*   **Improve code quality:** By leveraging the LLM's knowledge for best practices, bug detection, and code optimization.
*   **Facilitate learning:** By providing explanations and examples for new technologies or complex code sections.
*   **Streamline workflows:** By keeping the interaction within the terminal and integrating tightly with Git.

## Core Architecture

Aider's architecture is modular, designed to facilitate interaction between the developer, the local codebase, and the LLM.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI - `aider.main.main`):**
    *   The entry point for user interaction.
    *   Parses user commands (e.g., `/add`, `/drop`, `/run`, `/commit`, natural language prompts).
    *   Manages the chat session and displays output to the user.
    *   Handles user configuration from `~/.aider.conf.yml` or project-specific `.aider.conf.yml`.

2.  **Coder (`aider.coders.Coder` and its subclasses):**
    *   The central orchestrator responsible for managing the interaction with the LLM.
    *   Prepares the context to be sent to the LLM, including:
        *   The user's prompt.
        *   The chat history.
        *   Relevant code snippets from the files added to the chat.
        *   Repository map information (see RepoMap).
    *   Selects the appropriate LLM and parameters based on configuration.
    *   Sends the request to the LLM (via `litellm`).
    *   Receives the LLM's response, which typically includes explanations and code changes.
    *   Parses the LLM's response to extract code changes, which are often provided in specific edit formats (e.g., unified diff, or custom search/replace blocks).
    *   Applies the validated changes to the local files.
    *   Manages Git operations like committing changes.
    *   Different `Coder` subclasses might exist for different LLMs or edit formats (e.g., `WholeFileCoder`, `EditBlockCoder`).

3.  **LLM Interaction (`litellm`):**
    *   Aider uses `litellm` as an abstraction layer to communicate with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, open-source models, etc.).
    *   This allows Aider to be model-agnostic and easily support new LLMs.
    *   Handles API requests, authentication, and retries.

4.  **File Management (`aider.io.IO`):**
    *   Handles reading from and writing to local files.
    *   Ensures that file operations are safe and that users are prompted before overwriting unsaved changes.

5.  **Git Integration (`aider.git_utils`):**
    *   Deeply integrated with Git for version control.
    *   Adds files to the chat, tracks local changes, and determines which files are part of the Git repository.
    *   Stages and commits changes made by the AI (often with standardized commit messages).
    *   Can show diffs of pending changes.
    *   Uses Git to find the project root and ignore files specified in `.gitignore`.

6.  **Chat History (`aider.chat_history`):**
    *   Maintains a record of the conversation between the user and the LLM.
    *   This history is crucial for providing context to the LLM in subsequent turns.
    *   Saves the chat history to a Markdown file (e.g., `.aider.chat.history.md`) for persistence across sessions.

7.  **Repository Map (`aider.repomap.RepoMap`):**
    *   A critical component for providing the LLM with high-level context about the entire codebase, especially in larger projects.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Uses `universal-ctags` (via `aider.ctags`) to scan the repository and identify "tags" â€“ definitions of functions, classes, methods, variables, etc.
        *   Can also use **Tree-sitter** (`aider.linter.Linter`) for more precise parsing and identification of code elements and their context (e.g., function signatures, class definitions). Tree-sitter parsers are language-specific and provide a concrete syntax tree (CST), allowing for more granular understanding of code structure than ctags alone. This helps in identifying "important" symbols and their context.
        *   The `RepoMap` then ranks these tags/symbols based on their relevance (e.g., how recently they were modified, or if they are "close" to files already in the chat).
        *   It provides a condensed, token-efficient summary of the repository structure to the LLM. This might include just the signatures of functions/methods or class definitions.
        *   This helps the LLM understand relationships between different parts of the code without needing the entire content of all files, thus saving tokens and improving the relevance of its suggestions.
    *   The user can trigger a refresh of the repository map using the `/reindex` command.

8.  **Edit Formats and Parsing:**
    *   Aider instructs the LLM to return code changes in specific, structured formats. Common formats include:
        *   **Unified Diff Format:** Similar to `git diff` output.
        *   **Custom Edit Block Format:** Aider's own format, often using `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> REPLACE` markers to delineate search and replace blocks for precise changes.
    *   Aider has parsers to accurately interpret these formats and apply the changes to the correct locations in the files. This is more robust than simple text replacement.

**Primary Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   User runs `aider` in their terminal, optionally providing file paths to add to the chat.
    *   Aider loads configuration, initializes Git utilities, and sets up the chat history.
    *   The `RepoMap` may be generated or updated if configured.

2.  **User Interaction Loop:**
    *   User types a message (a prompt for the LLM) or a command (e.g., `/add <file>`, `/run <command>`).
    *   **Command Handling:** If it's a command, Aider executes it (e.g., adds a file to the `Coder`'s context, runs a shell command).
    *   **Prompt Handling:**
        *   The `Coder` assembles the prompt for the LLM, including the user's message, relevant chat history, code from currently "active" files, and the `RepoMap` summary.
        *   The `Coder` sends the prompt to the LLM via `litellm`.

3.  **LLM Processing & Response:**
    *   The LLM processes the request and generates a response.
    *   The response typically contains natural language explanations and code changes in one of the supported edit formats.

4.  **Response Processing & Code Application:**
    *   The `Coder` parses the LLM's response.
    *   It extracts code changes and presents them to the user for review (showing the diff).
    *   The user can approve (`y`), reject (`n`), edit (`e`), or take other actions on the proposed changes.
    *   If approved, the `Coder` applies the changes to the local files using its file I/O and edit parsing logic.

5.  **Git Commit:**
    *   If changes are applied and Git integration is active, Aider (often automatically) stages the modified files and commits them with a descriptive message (e.g., "aider: Applied edit for [user's prompt]").

6.  **Loop:** The process repeats from step 2.

## Key Technologies and Language

*   **Primary Language:** Python
*   **Core Libraries/Technologies:**
    *   **OpenAI API (and others via `litellm`):** For LLM interaction. `litellm` acts as a standardized interface to various LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Cohere, HuggingFace, Replicate, etc.), allowing Aider to be flexible in its choice of backend model. It handles request formatting, API key management, and provides a consistent response structure.
    *   **Git:** Essential for version control, file status tracking, diffing, applying changes, and committing. Aider leverages the `git` command-line tool extensively.
    *   **Universal Ctags:** Used by `RepoMap` to generate an index of symbols (functions, classes, etc.) in the repository, providing a high-level structural overview for the LLM.
    *   **Tree-sitter:** Used by `RepoMap` (often via `aider.linter.Linter`) for more advanced code parsing. Tree-sitter builds a concrete syntax tree (CST) of the source code, enabling more precise identification of code elements, their scopes, and relationships. This allows for more intelligent context gathering for the `RepoMap` and can also be used for syntax validation or more fine-grained code analysis. Aider may ship with or require users to have tree-sitter parsers for supported languages.
    *   **Pygments:** For syntax highlighting of code in the terminal output.
    *   **Prompt Toolkit:** For enhanced command-line input, history, and auto-completion.
    *   **Markdown:** Chat history is stored in Markdown format.
    *   **YAML:** Configuration files (`.aider.conf.yml`) are in YAML.

## Novel Tools/Techniques

*   **RepoMap with Ctags and Tree-sitter:** The `RepoMap` is a key innovation. By using `ctags` for broad symbol discovery and `tree-sitter` for deep, language-aware parsing, Aider provides LLMs with a highly effective summary of the codebase structure. This allows the LLM to understand context beyond just the files explicitly added to the chat, leading to more relevant and accurate code generation and modification, especially in large and complex repositories. Tree-sitter's ability to parse code incrementally and provide detailed syntax trees is particularly powerful for identifying function signatures, class definitions, and other important code constructs that form the backbone of the repository map.
*   **LLM-Agnosticism via LiteLLM:** Integrating `litellm` allows users to choose from a wide array of LLMs, not just OpenAI models. This provides flexibility in terms of cost, capabilities, and access to open-source or specialized models.
*   **Direct Codebase Interaction with Git Integration:** Aider's ability to let the LLM directly "edit" files in a local Git repository and then commit those changes is a powerful paradigm. The tight Git integration ensures changes are version-controlled, easily reviewable, and can be undone.
*   **Structured Edit Formats:** Requiring LLMs to output changes in specific, machine-parsable formats (like unified diffs or Aider's custom edit blocks) is crucial for reliably applying complex changes. This avoids the brittleness of relying on LLMs to perform free-form text replacements.
*   **Contextual Chat History:** Maintaining and utilizing chat history allows for iterative refinement and follow-up questions, making the interaction more conversational and effective.
*   **In-Terminal, Developer-Centric Workflow:** Aider focuses on integrating smoothly into existing developer workflows by operating within the terminal and leveraging familiar tools like Git.
*   **Automated Commit Generation:** Streamlines the process by creating Git commits for AI-generated changes, often including metadata about the prompt that led to the change.

By combining these components and techniques, Aider provides a robust and flexible platform for AI-assisted software development directly within the developer's preferred environment.
